# Dog Breed Identification Project

This project focuses on fine-grained image categorization, specifically determining the breed of a dog in an image. We use a strictly canine subset of ImageNet for practice.

## Objective
The goal is to accurately identify the breed of a dog from an image, with 120 breeds available. The challenge lies in the limited number of training images per class.

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated based on Multi Class Log Loss between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Dataset
The Stanford Dogs Dataset is used, with acknowledgment to Aditya Khosla, Nityananda Jayadevaprakash, Bangpeng Yao, and Fei-Fei Li for its creation.
